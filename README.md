# Kirjuri

Kirjuri is a simple php/mysql web application for managing physical forensic evidence items. It is intended to be used as a workflow tool from receiving, booking, note-taking and possibly reporting findings. It simplifies and helps in case management when dealing with a large (or small!) number of devices submitted for forensic analysis. Kirjuri requires PHP7.
