HTML Purifier 4.9.0 is a bugfix release, collecting a half year of
accumulated bug fixes.  A nice user-visible fix is that embedded
semicolons in CSS strings are now handled correctly; this should
make it possible to embed data URLs inside CSS (when they are
enabled).  Other helpful bugfixes are better URL handling when
idn_to_ascii() is defined, as well as less chmod'ing with the Serializer
cache.
